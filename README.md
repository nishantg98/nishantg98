 <summary><h3>üóª My DevOps Journey</h3></summary>
   My journey in DevOps showcases a comprehensive expertise spanning over two years, marked by notable achievements and contributions across various technologies and projects.

I began my professional journey as a Junior DevOps Engineer at Successive Digital in India. There, I played a pivotal role in driving the adoption of Kubernetes, resulting in a significant enhancement in infrastructure scalability and performance. My optimization efforts on Azure led to a remarkable improvement in application performance, handling millions of daily requests more efficiently. Collaborating with cross-functional teams, I established robust CI/CD pipelines, significantly reducing deployment time and enhancing system reliability. By implementing Infrastructure as Code practices with Terraform, I streamlined operations and minimized manual efforts substantially. Additionally, my role as an SRE involved troubleshooting complex issues, significantly increasing system stability.

My educational background, including an MSc in Information Systems and Operations Management from the University of Nottingham and a BEng in Computer Science and Engineering from Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, forms a solid foundation for my technical prowess.

My technical skills encompass a wide array of Cloud and DevOps tools, automation techniques, programming languages, and project management methodologies. Noteworthy mentions include proficiency in Azure, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Git, Python, PowerShell, Terraform, and CI/CD pipelines.

My significant project involvement in the DAN Media-Ecosystem project highlights my adeptness in managing complex infrastructures and orchestrating monitoring for numerous clusters and VMs. I ensured service level objectives were met through meticulous SLA/SLI/SLO frameworks and automated daily tasks, demonstrating a commitment to efficiency and reliability.

Furthermore, my Microsoft Certified Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900) certification underscores my dedication to continuous learning and staying abreast of industry best practices.

Overall, my DevOps journey exemplifies a blend of technical expertise, collaboration, and innovation, resulting in tangible improvements in system performance, reliability, and security.

Looking ahead, I'm driven by my commitment to keep learning and evolving in the DevOps field. Each step forward excites me as I explore new technologies and their potential.
